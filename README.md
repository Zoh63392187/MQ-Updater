## Everquest patchday and notes

Next time EverQuest patches and the MQ is outdated just run the script again and enjoy.
If MQ is not updated for the current version of EverQuest just wait another hour and try again

Please note that for the script to update your MQ installation the MQ Devs must have made a new release.
[Offcial MQ release](https://github.com/macroquest/macroquest/releases/) - All credit to the MQ devs and the hard work they do!
