## Everquest patchday and notes

Next time EverQuest patches and the MQ2 is outdated just run the script again and enjoy.
If MQ2 is not updated for the current version of EverQuest just wait another hour and try again

Please note that for the script to update your MQ2 installation the MQ2 Devs must have made a new release.
[Offcial MQ2 release](https://github.com/macroquest/macroquest/releases/) - All credit to the MQ2 devs and the hard work they do!
